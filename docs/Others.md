### Does SwitchBot Bot connect to multiple Hubs?

No. SwitchBot Bot automatically selects the nearest SwitchBot Hub Plus/Mini the first time you enable the Cloud Service for it in Bot Settings. It always uses the paired Hub Plus/Mini then.

If you have multiple Hubs, and your SwitchBot Bot is always not reachable via the Internet or via a third party ( Such as Alexa, Google Home, Siri), try to disable the Cloud Service for the SwitchBot Bot and enable it again.

### What is the difference between Infrared (IR), Bluetooth (BT), Radio Frequency (RF) remote controls of my appliances?

Since our Hub Mini, Ceiling Light remote control devices via Infrared (IR), it is NOT possible to use them for RF or Bluetooth-controlled remotes and appliances. The common formats of remote control signals are described below.

Infrared (Infrared)

Infrared is the only technology used in all of SwitchBot Hub Mini (and other Hub devices), Ceiling Light series, which use pulses of infrared light to send controller data to the appliance. Infrared is invisible to the human eye. Infrared signals do not penetrate walls, so communication is limited by distance and building materials.

To check your Hub Mini compatiblity, refer to:

[How do I know if my appliance remote is IR supported, and can be added to Hub Mini?](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/8072054481047)

Radio Frequency

Radio frequency (RF) is a data transmission technology which is based on electromagnetic radio waves. The advantage of RF is that this technology has a wider signal range. RF can go through and there is no need to point your remote to the device, as it does not require to be in line-of-sight.

Bluetooth

Bluetooth (which is a type of RF) is a wireless communication technology that uses radio waves of a specific frequency to transmit data from one device to another over short distances of up to 10 m. It is used in a variety of products, including

Amazon's Fire TV Stick

,

Roku TV Stick,

XGIMI, and many other electronics and digital devices controllers that use Bluetooth.

Since our Hub Mini control SwitchBot devices via Infrared (IR), it is not possible to use them for most of RF or Bluetooth controlled TV's or appliances.
